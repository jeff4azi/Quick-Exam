options: [
"Increased honey fermentation",
"Immediate death of the drones",
"Swarming as a reproductive response",

options: [
"Overcrowding and emergence of a new queen",
"Persistent disturbance, food shortage, and excessive heat",
"Presence of queen cells and abundant nectar",
"Strong floral resources and adequate ventilation"
],
correct: "Persistent disturbance, food shortage, and excessive heat",
reason: "Environmental stressors such as disturbance, hunger, and high temperature can cause the entire colony to abandon the hive (absconding)."

id: "vos118-063",
question: "Why is harvesting uncapped honey comb discouraged even during the official honey flow season?",
options: [
"It reduces wax production",
"It increases the number of drones",
"It may contain immature honey with unsafe moisture content",
"It prevents future nectar flow"
],
correct: "It may contain immature honey with unsafe moisture content",
reason: "Only capped comb indicates mature honey with moisture not exceeding 17%."
},
{
id: "vos118-064",
question: "If a beekeeper stands directly in front of the hive entrance during inspection, which behavioral principle explains the likely aggressive response?",
options: [
"Blocking the bees' flight path causes defensive reaction",
"Bees dislike human shadows",
"Smoke attracts predators",
"The queen signals attack immediately"
],
correct: "Blocking the bees' flight path causes defensive reaction",
reason: "Standing in the flight path is listed as an activity that angers bees during inspection."
},
{
id: "vos118-065",
question: "During the dearth season (April–June), what management priority should a beekeeper focus on?",
options: [
"Maximizing honey harvest",
"Providing supplementary feeding where necessary",
"Destroying all queen cells",
"Increasing hive population artificially"
],
correct: "Providing supplementary feeding where necessary",
reason: "Dearth season involves scarcity of nectar and pollen; supplementary feeding prevents swarming or absconding."
},
{
id: "vos118-066",
question: "A colony has abundant nectar, an active queen, and warm weather. What is the expected behavioral state of the bees during inspection?",
options: [
"Highly aggressive and defensive",
"Calm and manageable",
"Preparing to abscond",
"Unable to forage"
],
correct: "Calm and manageable",
reason: "Conducive atmosphere, nectar abundance, and active queen make bees friendlier during inspection."

id: "vos118-068",
question: "If honey is stored in a metal container and changes color and texture, what underlying principle explains this change?",
options: [
"Microbial contamination from air exposure",
"Mineral reaction between metal and honey",
"Excess nectar in the hive",
"Poor filtration during extraction"
],
