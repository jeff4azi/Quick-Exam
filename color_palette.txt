Good. This is a serious, sensible palette. I’ll critique it like a product designer building for students under stress, not like Dribbble aesthetics.

Overall verdict

This palette is solid and appropriate for a CBT/exam app.
No childish colors, no distractions, no ego choices. Bien joué.

Now let’s go layer by layer and tighten it.


---

1. Primary blue — #2563EB

Use: buttons, selected answers, CTA
Verdict: ✅ Excellent choice

Trustworthy

Academic

Familiar (feels “official”)

Strong contrast on light backgrounds


One rule:
Don’t use this blue everywhere. Reserve it strictly for:

Primary CTA (Start Exam, Next)

Selected option highlight


If it’s everywhere, it loses authority.


---

2. Background — #F8FAFC

Verdict: ✅ Perfect

Calm

Easy on the eyes

Doesn’t fight content

Good for long sessions


This is exactly what exam tools should use. Do not darken it.


---

3. Cards — #FFFFFF

Verdict: ✅ Correct

White cards on a soft gray background = clarity + hierarchy.

Suggestion (tiny): Add very subtle shadow or border:

Border: #E5E7EB

Shadow: low opacity


Don’t float them too much — this is not a dashboard app.


---

4. Text — #1F2937

Verdict: ✅ Excellent

This is one of the best choices you made.

Not pure black → less eye strain

Still very readable

Professional


Use this for:

Questions

Options

Labels


For secondary text (course name, hints):

Drop opacity or use #6B7280



---

5. Secondary accent (cyan) — #06B6D4

Verdict: ⚠️ Use carefully

Cyan is nice, but:

It attracts attention fast

It can feel “techy” if overused


Use it ONLY for:

Links

Small highlights

Maybe progress indicator fill (light use)


Do not use it for:

Main buttons

Important actions

Error states


This keeps it classy.


---

6. Status colors (this is important)

✅ Correct — #16A34A

Perfect. Calm green, not celebratory. Good.

❌ Wrong — #DC2626

Strong red — good, but:

Don’t use it for big backgrounds

Use it for:

Icons

Borders

Text indicators



Avoid flashing red blocks. That stresses users.

⚠️ Timer / warning — #F59E0B

Good choice if:

It only appears when time is almost up

Default timer stays neutral (gray)


Don’t show orange from the start — that creates anxiety.


---

7. One missing piece (important)

You didn’t mention a neutral border / divider color.

Add:

Border / divider: #E5E7EB or #CBD5E1


This helps structure without adding noise.


---

Final product advice (this matters)

Your palette says:

> “This is serious, helpful, and calm.”



That’s exactly what you want for exams.

Do not chase beauty now.
Consistency > creativity.

Lock this palette.
Don’t tweak it for 2 weeks.

Next step should not be colors anymore — it should be building one screen using these tokens.

If you want, next I can:

Map these colors to Tailwind classes cleanly, or

Tell you exactly which colors go on which elements (button states, options, results)


But don’t redesign again.
This part is done.
